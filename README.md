# CompassPlugin

My first project: a minecraft plugin with navigation features on the minecraft world.

Current Plans:
-Create a compass on the bossbar that updates regurarly.
-Give users the flexibility to turn it on/off, add and remove features from the display.
-Add features such as bearings, North/South/East/West directions.
-Add coordinate tracking.
